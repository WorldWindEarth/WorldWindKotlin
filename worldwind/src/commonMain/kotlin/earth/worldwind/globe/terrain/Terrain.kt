/**
 * Surface of a planet or celestial object.
 * <br>
 * Models the geometric surface defined by an ellipsoidal globe and its
 * associated elevations. Terrain uses the Cartesian coordinate system specified by a GeographicProjection and
 * is capable of representing both a 3D ellipsoid and a 2D map projection, though not simultaneously.
 * <br>
 * <h3>Caching Terrain Queries</h3>
 *
 * Terrain implementations typically model a subset of the globe's surface at varying
 * resolution. In this case results from the methods `intersect` and `surfacePoint` cannot be cached. Either
 * method may fail to compute a result when the terrain surface has no geometry in the region queried, and even if
 * computation is successful the result is based on an unknown resolution. However, if the terrain implementation is
 * known to model a pre-determined resolution and region of interest results from the methods `intersect` and
 * `surfacePoint` may be cached.
