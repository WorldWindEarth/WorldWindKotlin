 * Specifies the position within the Icon that is "anchored" to the <Point> specified in the Placemark.
 * The x and y values can be specified in three different ways: as pixels ("pixels"), as fractions of the icon ("fraction"),
 * or as inset pixels ("insetPixels"), which is an offset in pixels from the upper right corner of the icon.
 * The x and y positions can be specified in different waysâ€”for example, x can be in pixels and y can be a fraction.
 * The origin of the coordinate system is in the lower left corner of the icon.
