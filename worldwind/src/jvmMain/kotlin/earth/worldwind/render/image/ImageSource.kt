 * - Uniform Resource Locator [URL]
 * - Local image [File]
 * - [BufferedImage] object
 * - WorldWind [ImageSource.ImageFactory]
 * - Multi-platform resource identifier
 * <br>
 * ImageSource instances are intended to be used as a key into a cache or other data structure that enables sharing of
 * loaded images. BufferedImages and WorldWind image factories are compared by reference. File paths and URLs with the
